    <h1>Seminar readings</h1>
    <h2>What do Prototypes Prototype?</h2>
    <p>Quote 1:
“What is significant is not what media or tools were used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.”
Response:
This quote shows that the value of a prototype does not depend on the tools or materials used to make it. What really matters is the purpose behind it. Even a simple prototype can be meaningful if it helps answer an important design question.
Quote 2:
“By focusing on the purpose of the prototype, that is, on what it prototypes, we can make better decisions about the kinds of prototypes to build.”
Response:
Houde and Hill emphasize that designers should think about why they are building a prototype before deciding how to build it. Prototyping is not just about making something look good, but about testing specific ideas such as function, appearance, or technology.
Quote 3:
“Finished-looking or behaving prototypes are often thought to indicate that the design they represent is near completion, but a finished-looking prototype might be made early in the design process.”
Response:
This quote explains that a polished prototype does not always mean the design is finished. Sometimes designers create detailed prototypes early to explore ideas. Understanding this helps avoid confusion when discussing designs with others.</p>
  <h2>Programming Design Systems</h2>
  <p>Quote 1:
“We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.”
Response:
This quote suggests that design today is more about systems than individual objects. Instead of focusing only on final products, designers need to think about processes and how things work together.
Quote 2:
“If graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.”
Response:
This statement highlights how important it is for designers to understand digital tools and programming. In a technology-driven world, these skills are necessary for designers to stay relevant and competitive.
Quote 3:
“Throwing a design over the wall for production is a bad legacy of the printed page, and there is no reason for the design process to end with the birth of a product.”
Response:
This quote criticizes the idea that design work ends once a product is finished. Digital products continue to change, so designers should stay involved after launch and keep improving their work.</p>

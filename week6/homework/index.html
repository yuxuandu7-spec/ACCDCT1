    <p>3 quotes for What do Prototypes Prototype:
    1. “What is significant is not what media or tools were used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.”

    Response:
    This quote challenges a common misconception that the fidelity or medium of a prototype determines its value. What truly matters is intent—the questions a prototype is built to answer. It's a powerful reminder that even simple, low-tech models can yield deep insights if they are purposefully used.
    2. “By focusing on the purpose of the prototype—that is, on what it prototypes—we can make better decisions about the kinds of prototypes to build.”

    Response:
    Houde and Hill shift the conversation from how prototypes look to why they exist. This insight reframes prototyping as a strategic act of inquiry rather than a step toward production. It encourages designers to think critically about what they’re testing—be it role, look and feel, or implementation—before they start building.
    3. “Finished-looking (or -behaving) prototypes are often thought to indicate that the design they represent is near completion… [but] a finished-looking prototype might be made early in the design process.”

    Response:
    This observation exposes a persistent bias in design evaluation: the assumption that polish equals progress. By decoupling visual finish from developmental stage, the authors argue for more nuanced understanding among stakeholders. A highly polished mockup might be exploratory, not final—and recognizing that distinction is essential for productive design conversations.
       3 quotes for Programming Design Systems:
    1. “We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.”
    
    Response:
    This quote captures a profound cultural shift: design is no longer about isolated artifacts, but about dynamic processes and interactions. It challenges designers to think less about the final product and more about the systems that generate, adapt, and sustain it.
    2. “If graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.”

    Response:
    This statement is both provocative and urgent. It underscores the necessity for designers to embrace programming and computational thinking—not as optional skills, but as core to remaining effective and employable in a digital-first world.
        3. “Throwing a design over the wall for production is a bad legacy of the printed page, and there is no reason for the design process to end with the birth of a product.”

    Response:
        This critique of the traditional “handoff” model highlights the importance of iteration and collaboration in modern design. Digital products evolve after launch, so the designer's role must evolve too—participating in ongoing refinement, testing, and adaptation.

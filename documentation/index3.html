    <h1>Week 7 Interactive System with UI</h1>
  <h2>Intent</h2>
  <p>The goal of this project is to model a small interactive system using object-oriented programming and observe how simple rules can create emergent behavior.
I chose to build a pond ecosystem with three elements: lotus leaves, frogs, and flies.
Each element has a clear role:
1. Lotus leaves provide resting places for frogs
2. Frogs move around the pond and eat flies
3. Flies move randomly and act as food for frogs
By connecting these elements, the system shows how relationships between objects can affect the overall behavior of the environment.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>I first planned the system by deciding what objects were needed and how they would interact.
Each element in the system was turned into its own class: Lotus, Frog, and Fly.
1. Flies move randomly around the canvas
2. Frogs search for nearby flies and move toward them
3. When a frog gets close to a fly, the fly is removed (eaten)
4. After eating, frogs return to the nearest lotus leaf to rest
User interaction is added by allowing the user to click the mouse to create new flies, which changes how frogs behave.
Emergent behavior appears when multiple frogs and flies are present.
Without direct control, frogs naturally compete for food and move between hunting and resting states, creating a dynamic system that changes over time.</p>

    <h1>Archeology of the Futures</h1>
    <h2>Deriction and Description</h2>
    <p> One problem I encountered was that the movement of the circle was not smooth when using random values. The motion looked too sudden and messy. I solved this by using Perlin noise to control the velocity, which made the movement smoother and more natural.
Another problem was that the circle sometimes moved out of the canvas. To fix this, I used the constrain() function so the circle always stays inside the screen.
I also had an issue with placing the image correctly inside the circle. By using imageMode(CENTER) and drawing the image at the same position as the circle, the image stayed centered while moving.</p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p> The most interesting problem was making the movement look natural. Random movement felt unnatural and uncomfortable to watch. It did not match the calm feeling of the images.
I solved this by using Perlin noise instead of random numbers. Perlin noise changes slowly, so the movement became smoother and more expressive. This made the animation feel more alive and visually pleasing.

    <h1>Week 5 Time and oscillation</h1>
    <h2>Animation Process</h2>
    <img src="images/1.jpg" alt="Animation Process">
    <p>1. This is the initial experiment using only rotating squares. The movement is simple and continuous.</p>
    <img src="images/2.png" alt="Animation Process">
    <p>2. I adjusted the sizes and colors of the squares to explore visual balance and layering.</p>
    <img src="images/3.png" alt="Animation Process">
    <p>3. Variation was added to the rotation, creating more dynamic and less uniform movement between the squares.</p>
    <img src="images/4.png" alt="Animation Process">
    <p>4. Circular arcs were introduced as a second shape, while the squares remained the main focus.</p>
    <img src="images/5.jpg" alt="Animation Process">
    <p>5. More rings were added and animated, increasing the complexity and creating a stronger rhythm between shapes.</p>
    <img src="images/6.png" alt="Animation Process">
    <p>6. In the final version, both shapes move with different timing and speeds, forming a layered and de-synchronized motion.</p>

    <h1>Week 10 Blinkenlights</h1>
<h2>Pattern 1: SOS Morse Code LED Signal</h2>
<p>This pattern recreates the classic SOS distress signal used in Morse code. It consists of three short blinks, three long blinks, and then three short blinks again. I chose this pattern because it is simple, universally recognized, and naturally rhythmic. Short blinks are 200 ms, while long blinks are 600 ms. A 2-second pause separates each repetition.</p>
<h2>Pattern 1: Heartbeat Rhythm</h2>
<p>This pattern imitates a heartbeat. The LED flashes twice quickly and then pauses before repeating. The rhythm feels natural and similar to a human heart.
I adjusted the delay time to make the heartbeat feel more realistic. Small timing changes make a big difference in how the rhythm feels.</p>
<h2>Pattern 3: Dance Beat Rhythm</h2>
<p>This pattern is inspired by a simple music beat. The LED follows a four-beat rhythm with short flashes and one longer flash in the middle.
I wanted to see how a musical rhythm could be shown using only one LED. Different flash lengths help create a clear beat.</p>

    <h1>Week 13 Milti-channel controller</h1>
    <p>Although only a single button was used, it was designed as a multi-state controller. Different button interactions trigger different visual behaviors, effectively creating multiple control channels from one physical input.
    <h2>Work Process</h2>
    <p>I connected a button to an ESP32 on pin 27 using the internal pull-up resistor.
    The ESP32 reads the button state and sends 1 or 0 to Processing through serial.
    In Processing, the button is used to switch between different visual modes instead of just on and off.
    Each button press changes how the visuals behave.</p>
    </p>
     <h2>Result</h2>
     <p>The button controls multiple visual parameters by switching modes.
    Even with only one button, the interaction feels rich and dynamic.
    This project shows how a simple input can create different visual effects.</p>
